# Learning Time

This is explicit time invested in developing your skills or working on something
interesting that is of value to the team such as a proof of concept refactor or
spiking on a new technology or library we might want to use.

This is intended to be different from the implicit learning that you do on the
job while building features or maintaining existing code.

## When

- Friday afternoons following a cycle's engineering retro

## What
- Prefer product/company related areas (e.g., Rails, React, etc.)

## How
- Example uses:
    - Test case / proof of concept PRs
    - Upcase / Egghead.io tutorials/course, etc.
    - Refactor PRs
    - Something totally different that helps the team
- Defer to tech lead / product manager if something urgent needs to be addressed
  instead
