# Style

- Create commits as needed while working, but before merging to master, squash
  your commits down to the minimum number that makes sense (a single commit if
  it's reasonable, or a few).
- Except for minor changes, give each a commit message that has a title AND a
  body, where you explain why the change was necessary and what your approach
  was (unless self-explanatory from the code).
- Add a link to the Pivotal ticket somewhere in the PR description.
- Add any relevant labels to your PR.
