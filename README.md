# Working Agreements

## How to Use These Working Agreements

- These working agreements are intended for the engineering team, and for the
  product team in their interactions with the engineering team.
- These working agreements are NOT a substitute for company or engineering team
  policy, but rather a supplement to document team conventions in situations not
  covered by official policies.
- Any team member can propose changes to these agreements at retro.
- Proposed changes will be decided on by managers or by team vote.
- Even if you disagree with a given agreement and you have been unable to get a
  change passed, be a team player and follow the agreement anyway. Otherwise the
  entire system is ineffective. The topic can always be revisited at a later
  time if people change their minds.
