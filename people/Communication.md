# Core Hours: 10:30AM â€“ 3:30PM

Core hours consist of hours during which all employees are expected to be
available for communication and able to respond promptly (barring meetings).
They are a subset of working hours, which are the hours during which an
individual is working.

If you are unavailable during a part of core hours, please mark that on your
calendar and/or inform someone of your absence. This is especially important
when WFH as people are less able to check if you are at your desk.

This policy is not here for us to police it actively - but rather to set
explicit expectations of availability.

# Slack and Day-to-Day Communication

- No chitchat in the #engineering or #releases Slack channels.  (To determine
  what is considered appropriate for #engineering or #releases, imagine that
  every message you send in those channels is prefixed with @channel.)
- Use similar discretion for team-specific channels.
- Err on the side of messaging someone in chat before talking to them in person.
- Other channels will not be strictly moderated. If a channel is distracting
  you, leave the channel or "mute" it.
- Be considerate when using @channel or @here
- You can use Slack's "Do Not Disturb" mode to disable all notifications
  temporarily. This way other people can still feel comfortable leaving you a
  message, but they'll see that you're in DND mode and might not get back to
  them immediately, and it won't interrupt you.
