# Meetings

## Standup

- Be there for your team's standup or post your update in Slack if you can't be
  there in person.
  - Being there for standup is important. Missing it should be an exception.
    Your team should not be surprised.
  - Some teams have de-emphasized the traditional daily in-person scrum. If you
    are on one of those teams, you know how things are done.
- Standup updates follow conventional "agile" format: what you did yesterday,
  what you're doing today, and whether you have any blockers.
- Don't get into in-depth discussions while there are still people waiting to
  give their updates. If there's something you want to discuss, call it out
  during your update so people can talk after the standup.

## Retrospective

### Engineering Retrospectives

Retro includes time for team members to express things that are relevant to
the entire team, including announcements, praise, thank-yous, suggestions,
concerns, and proposed changes to working agreements.

### Team Retrospectives

At in-team retrospectives, teams discuss the past cycle - what went well, what
could go better, as well as any of the things mentioned for Engineering
Retrospectives.
